# Go Sort

This code was a way for me to learn writing Go code by implementing common sorting algorithms using [what I created with C](https://github.com/richardwalenga/csort) as a guide. I have logging in [main.go](main.go) which times the implementations against the same large array of random ints.

## Running

To run it, just execute this:
```
go build && go run .
```

For convenience I added a VSCode task called "run" which effectively does the same thing.
